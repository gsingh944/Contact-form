                        At Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology, I am pursuing a degree in computer programming (CPP). My ambition is to work as a web developer. I'm familiar with a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Java, JavaScript, and others. I prefer web programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS since these languages allow me to work on webpages and construct designs.
                         In today's cutting-edge environment, these are the most useful languages.

                        I am constantly eager to learn new things and never pass up an opportunity to do so. I worked on a project with four pals in high school that was focused on trigonometric values such as sin, cos, tan, cosec, cot, and so on. Every trigonometric function, as we all know, has a certain angle. 
The project's fundamental concept is to expand a specific type of color type to a given value by contacting wires with batteries.That project was particularly reliant on electronic wiring concepts. And the best part is that I earned first place in the project competition. 
Secondly, I created a project on how to make soil productive and make nature and the environment more beautiful by keeping water purity, which got first place in my city.
